# Project Title: Bike Headlight
## Problem Statement
Riding a bike in town at night presents riders with a more unsafe riding situation than day-time riding. I would like to create a good looking enclosure for a Fibonacci 64 LED PCB board that can be controlled by a Pixelblaze v3 controller to provide a "headlight" for my mountain bike that will make it very easy to see a person riding their bike in the dark.

The goal  is to initially create a 3D printed enclosure for the Pixelblaze, battery, circular LED PCB, along with a clear diffusing cover for the light that can mount to the handlebar or stem of a bike. I would like to eventually try to mill the enclosure out of wood, but I'll start with 3D printing for the flexibility and simplicity of that process.

### Project Components
The [Fibonacci 64](https://www.evilgeniuslabs.org/fibonacci64) board by Evil Genius Labs is a circular PCB with 64 addressable RGB leds.

The [Pixelblaze v3](https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblaze) LED controller will be used to create patterns in the Fibonacci 64 LED board that will illuminate the bike headlight.

The [SparkFun LiPo Charger/Booster](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14411) will be used to charge the LiPo battery which powers the project and provides and on/off switch, usb-c charging capabilities, and boosts the output of the 3.7v LiPo up to 5 volts.
