# Project Title: Bike Headlight
## Problem Statement
Riding a bike in town at night presents riders with a more unsafe riding situation than day-time riding. I would like to create a good looking enclosure for a Fibonacci 64 LED PCB board that can be controlled by a Pixelblaze v3 controller to provide a "headlight" for my mountain bike that will make it very easy to see a person riding their bike in the dark.

The goal  is to initially create a 3D printed enclosure for the Pixelblaze, battery, circular LED PCB, along with a clear diffusing cover for the light that can mount to the handlebar or stem of a bike. I would like to eventually try to mill the enclosure out of wood, but I'll start with 3D printing for the flexibility and simplicity of that process.
