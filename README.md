# BikeLight

The goal of this project is to design a light to increase visibilty of a bicycle at night. This handlebar mounted light will primarily serve to provide a colorful and customizable light so that people can easily see the bike in the dark. The light will provide some illumination for the rider, but will not replace a traditional handlebar mounted light for lighting up the street ahead of the rider.
