Worked in Onshape to continue initial 3D model of bike light enclosure to house the electronics components, battery, and diffusing cover and eventually mount to bike handles. Add features to the 3D model to hold the components and allow for a USB-C charging cord to plug in as well as a place for a simple external on/off switch that will attach to the LiPo battery Booster board. The current plan is for the battery to be glues to the platform on the backside of the enclosure opposite the Fib 64 LED PCB. On this same surface, I'll attach the Pixelblaze and battery booster. Here are a few pictures of the progress.

Conversation with Chris Suter and next steps...
Chris and I looked at the initial design and talked through a few of the design challenges that I run across while thinking through the first prototype.
#### Challenge 1: The Battery booster board has a place to plug in a USB-micro charger, but it will be difficult to place that plug flush against the side of the inside of the round enclouse and also difficult to mount it with the screw holes.
Potential solution: Use a USB-micro extension cable [like this](https://www.amazon.com/YCS-Basics-Cellphone-Charging-Extension/dp/B00B5HSC20) to allow the battery booster board to be more centrally located inside the enclouse and then I can route the USB-C extension plug right up to the hole in the side of the enclosure.

Started documenting the bike headlight project.
Began building out Github page for this project.
Created a 3D scan using Polycam iPhone app. Uploaded OBJ exported 3D file to Sketchfab. View the 3D model on [Sketchfab](https://skfb.ly/opvV9)
