Worked in Onshape to continue initial 3D model of bike light enclosure to house the electronics components, battery, and diffusing cover and eventually mount to bike handles. Add features to the 3D model to hold the components and allow for a USB-C charging cord to plug in as well as a place for a simple external on/off switch that will attach to the LiPo battery Booster board. The current plan is for the battery to be glues to the platform on the backside of the enclosure opposite the Fib 64 LED PCB. On this same surface, I'll attach the Pixelblaze and battery booster. Here are a few pictures of the progress.

Conversation with Chris Suter and next steps.
